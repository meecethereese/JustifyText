Aligning text in a document is one way to make it more beautiful. Documents break text into lines
as soon as the maximum width of the line is reached. These alignments give the ability to align
the text to one side of the document. But times, documents have dangling text, empty spaces at the
end of the lines. This is where justify text alignment comes in.

Introduction to Justify Alignment

Justify text alignment is an alignment that removes as many spaces as possible from the ends of
the lines. The goal is no spaces at the end of any line, at all so that the resulting document
looks as follows.

To align text like this is not as easy as it seems. There are many hurdles to making words fit in
a line of a specific size. To tackle such issues, do this.

Adding extra spaces between words in the sentence

Breaking long words down: “environment” into “enviro-” and "nment"

However, using either approach carelessly leads to an ugly-looking sentence and document. To avoid
that, we compute costs and use the combination with the minimum cost.

In this project, we will justify text in JavaScript to get more hands-on experience.
